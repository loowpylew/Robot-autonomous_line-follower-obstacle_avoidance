# Robot-autonomous_line-follower-obstacle_avoidance

- This requires the use of 'thymio suite'. 
- The programming language used was a mix between c and c++ (Does not have a definitive name) 
- Once thymio has been downloaded, you will then have to select 'asebea studio' option
- You will then have to launch a simulator by uploading the 'AreanSim' playground file which is the environment setup designed to allow the robots to follow a line/avoid objects     which can be moved using the mouse in the path of the robot. 
- When the robots meet on the same line, they will avoid each other by turning in opposite directions in a semi circle like manor. 
- You will also have to upload the code for both robots to aseba studio.

Main issues you may encounter when running the code is that the software does not recognise constants defined. Unsure why this is the case, but the solution is to remove the existing constant and then re-define exactly how it was before. 

Enviroment has been uploaded alongside number of robots to be used
